# JavaPOS 

The UnifiedPOS reference implementation for Java provided by UnifiedPOS committee members.

Use this library, if your are implementing JavaPOS device services or an JavaPOS application using the [reference implementation of device controls](https://github.com/JavaPOSWorkingGroup/javapos-controls) provided by this group (instead of using your own). In that case this library is valid to be deployed to production environments too.

If you have implemented your own version of device controls use the both libraries [javapos-contracts](https://github.com/JavaPOSWorkingGroup/javapos-contracts) and [javapos-config-loader](https://github.com/JavaPOSWorkingGroup/javapos-config-loader) instead of this one to avoid class ambiguities on your classpath.

NOTE: The documentation shown here in the past about project evolving has been moved to a [Wiki page](https://github.com/JavaPOSWorkingGroup/javapos/wiki/Migrating-to-And-Joining-All-Sources-At-GitHub).
